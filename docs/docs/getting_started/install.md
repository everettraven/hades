Currently hades does not have a released version and needs to be installed by building from source.

To build hades from source:

1. Install the Go programming language: https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Install Git if you don't already have it: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
3. Clone the hades GitHub Repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/everettraven/hades.git
```
4. Change directory into the cloned repository by running:
``` 
cd hades
```
5. Install hades by running:
```
go install
```

Now hades is installed on your system! Check out our guides for some examples you can run to get a hang of hades.
